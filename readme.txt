== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the plugin work? =
When activated, the plugin automatically creates a "Submit Ticket" page where users can submit support tickets. Once a support ticket has been submitted, you will be notified via an email. To view the support ticket, log in to your wordpress admin section, click on "Support Tickets" in the left navigation and then click on "Edit". At the top right, you should notice options to change your support ticket status as well as assign a ticket priority. Notifications are sent out when there is a new support ticket as well as when there are new support ticket responses - these can be changed in the settings page.

= How do I edit the Submit Ticket page? =
The Submit Ticket page is created automatically upon activation. To edit, please go to Pages in your left navigation and edit the relevant page. Please remember to keep the shortcode on the page so that the submit ticket form shows correctly.

= How do I add a support desk / help desk to my website? =
In the basic version of the plugin, only a "Submit ticket" page is created. Should you wish to add a fully customizable help desk to your front end that shows public open/closed tickets and a search feature, please consider purchasing the premium version of the plugin for only $29.99 once off. Updates included forever.
